VERSION ZIAIC00025 REVB3  5/20/20  R.Hormigo



Main P1
1- PGM switch shoud be RST and go to J3 and Arduino connector side RST. (The Arduino 6 pin program port still will be lelf as PGM)
2- VPWR needs new SK Diode (D16) for inverted voltage peaks from inductance at Motor Controllers
3- R1 to R14 changed to 20 Ohm. The hiher value interfered specially with clocks and high frequency signals 

DC Motors P2
1- C11 and C14 to have parallel 10uF caps
2- R45 and R31 must be 0.025 Ohm to hadle higher currents.
Steppers P2
1- ~RESET signal gets unified in D43, D47 goes for Interrupt in new GPIO expander chip

Inst. Amplifiers P3
1-Change R65 to 4.3K to create a reference of 1.5V. Needed to center DC out range on amps to ADC
  (Change all 4.7Ks in board to 4.3K to unify values, this is the only critical one)
2-Eliminate voltage divider by default in exit. R74 fom 10K to 2.2K, and R77 removed NP.
3- Remove ADC Aref by default 3V, So R88 goes NP

Switches P3
Signals moved from A3 UP, A11 DW, and A10 SEL to New I/O Expander 8 UP, 9 DW, and 10 SEL @P4 , so A10 and A11 are still available in Arduino expansion.  

LEDs P4
Signals moved from D10 Green, D12 R, D54 G, and D55 B to New I/O Expander 4 R, 5 G, 6 B, and 7 Green  @P4, so these original signals are now GPIO and Buzzer dedicated

NEW IO EXPANDER IC24 
Controls now Switches, LEDs, and has available 13 GPIO ports (4 shared with LEDs) using J41, and J42. All ports have PWM and pull up/down capabiity. 

GPIO/BUZZER P4
Buzzer is now a piezo trandsducer regulable in loudness with trimmer R117 and goes single ended controlled by D10. Removed original R127 and R128.
Can also drive external buzzer.  

  
Audio OUTPUT P5
1- Audio Amp R148 goes from 16K to 2X15K in parallel (7.5K)
2-Paralell 10uF with C53

Audio IN P5
1- Use MLCC 10uF 35V X7R for C45, C47
2- Reduce R137 from 500K to 200K
3- Replace R130 with 0 Ohm
4- Add Pi filtering from 5V rail in R143 2 X 2.2K and 10uF cap
5- R148 changed now 2 X 15K (7.5K)
6- I2C Address
7- Global Reset for IC22 I2S in ~PD 
8- Added aditional bypass for low freq current ripple C69



Fixes in prototype REVA :
R10, R12, R14 changed to 0 (Audio I2S)
Placed new protection Sk Diode D16
PGM Switch changed to RST
R31, and R45 have two parallel 0.056 (0.028 Ohm)
Added bypass 10uF caps in parallel with C11, C14.
R65 to 4.3k (using a 4.7K on top of a 56K)
R75 had wrong value 10K * that limits gain
R74, R96 changed to 2.2K
R77, R97 Removed
IC16 broken and remplaced * This id what broke 4 GPIOs


 5/18/2020 Sent for PCB Fab to PCBWay W27198ASR11_ZIAIC00025B.zip TeenScience
    Then fixed fab note to request Fr4 150 material (that is widely more available and inexpensive)
    Added origin and fiducials note in Fab Notes for manufacturing.
    Regenerated CAM set of files is REV B2 files now.


5/19 After sent to PCB manufacturing and CM files found a few issues that the CM has now on time, for the PCB is cosmetic and not worth but REVB3 files have been done

 -Schematic and BOM had to wrong part# for header connectors J41 and J42, fixed and generated new schematic and BOM REV B3
 -Centroid of Microphone MK1 was off and the silkscreen pin 1 was on the flip side. Updated footprint and generated new Silkscreen top geber and Pick and Place file. 

5/20
	After reviewing feendback from CM of a missing part (pipes lights) and speaker, I realized schematic is not giving BOM out for non PCB items. 
        Added a dummy footprint on library for these parrs and updated BOM as REV B4
